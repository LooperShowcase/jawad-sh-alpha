          Elon Reeve Musk FRS (/ˈiːlɒn/ EE-lon; born June 28, 1971) is an
          entrepreneur and business magnate. He is the founder, CEO, and Chief
          Engineer at SpaceX; early stage investor, CEO, and Product Architect of
          Tesla, Inc.; founder of The Boring Company; and co-founder of Neuralink
          and OpenAI. A centibillionaire, Musk is the richest person in the world
          as of September 2021.[2] Musk was born to a Canadian mother and South
          African father and raised in Pretoria, South Africa. He briefly attended
          the University of Pretoria before moving to Canada aged 17 to attend
          Queen's University. He transferred to the University of Pennsylvania two
          years later, where he received bachelor's degrees in economics and
          physics. He moved to California in 1995 to attend Stanford University
          but decided instead to pursue a business career, co-founding the web
          software company Zip2 with brother Kimbal. The startup was acquired by
          Compaq for $307 million in 1999. The same year, Musk co-founded online
          bank X.com, which merged with Confinity in 2000 to form PayPal. The
          company was bought by eBay in 2002 for $1.5 billion.

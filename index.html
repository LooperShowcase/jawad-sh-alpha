      Tesla, Inc. (/ˈtɛslə/ TESS-lə or /ˈtɛzlə/ TEZ-lə[a]) is an American
      electric vehicle and clean energy company based in Palo Alto, California,
      <br />
      energy storage from home to grid-scale, solar panels and solar roof tiles,
      and related products and services. In 2020, Tesla had the most sales of
      battery electric vehicles and plug-in electric vehicles, capturing 16% of
      the plug-in market (which includes plug-in hybrids) and 23% of the
      <br />
      battery-electric (purely electric) market. Through its subsidiary Tesla
      Energy, the company develops and is a major installer of photovoltaic
      systems in the United States. Tesla Energy is also one of the largest
      global suppliers of battery energy storage systems, with 3 gigawatt-hours

      Founded in July 2003 by Martin Eberhard and Marc Tarpenning as Tesla
      Motors, the company's name is a tribute to inventor and electrical
      engineer Nikola Tesla. In February 2004, via a US$6.5 million investment,
      X.com co-founder Elon Musk became the largest shareholder of the company
      and its chairman. He has served as CEO since 2008. According to Musk, the
      purpose of Tesla is to help expedite the move to sustainable transport and
      energy, obtained through electric vehicles and solar power. Tesla began
      production of its first car model, the Roadster, in 2009. This was
      followed by the Tesla Model S sedan in 2012, the Tesla Model X SUV in
      2015, the Tesla Model 3 sedan in 2017, and the Tesla Model Y crossover in
      2020. The Tesla Model 3 is the all-time best-selling plug-in electric car
      worldwide, and, in June 2021, became the first electric car to sell 1
      million units globally.[7] Tesla's global vehicle sales were 499,550 units
      in 2020, a 35.8% increase over the previous year.

        Elon Reeve Musk FRS (/ˈiːlɒn/ EE-lon; born June 28, 1971) is an
        entrepreneur and business magnate. He is the founder, CEO, and Chief
        Engineer at SpaceX; early stage investor, CEO, and Product Architect of
        Tesla, Inc.; founder of The Boring Company; and co-founder of Neuralink
        and OpenAI. A centibillionaire, Musk is the richest person in the world
        as of September 2021.[2] Musk was born to a Canadian mother and South
        African father and raised in Pretoria, South Africa. He briefly attended
        the University of Pretoria before moving to Canada aged 17 to attend
        Queen's University. He transferred to the University of Pennsylvania two
        years later, where he received bachelor's degrees in economics and
        physics. He moved to California in 1995 to attend Stanford University
        but decided instead to pursue a business career, co-founding the web
        software company Zip2 with brother Kimbal. The startup was acquired by
        Compaq for $307 million in 1999. The same year, Musk co-founded online
        bank X.com, which merged with Confinity in 2000 to form PayPal. The
        company was bought by eBay in 2002 for $1.5 billion.

        The Tesla Semi is an all-electric battery-powered Class 8 semi-truck in
        development by Tesla, Inc. Two concept vehicles were unveiled in
        November 2017, and production in 2023 is planned.[2] The company
        initially announced that the truck would have a 500 miles (805 km) range
        on a full charge and with its new batteries it would be able to run for
        400 miles (640 km) after an 80% charge in 30 minutes using a
        solar-powered "Tesla Megacharger" charging station. Tesla CEO Elon Musk
        said that the Semi would come standard with Tesla Autopilot that allows
        semi-autonomous driving on highways

    <h2>History</h2>
    <p>
      The company was incorporated as Tesla Motors, Inc. on July 1, 2003, by
      Martin Eberhard and Marc Tarpenning.[8] Eberhard and Tarpenning served as
      CEO and CFO, respectively.[9] Eberhard said he wanted to build "a car
      manufacturer that is also a technology company", with its core
      technologies as "the battery, the computer software, and the proprietary
      motor".[10] Ian Wright was Tesla's third employee, joining a few months
      later.[8] In February 2004, the company raised $7.5 million in series A
      funding, including $6.5 million from Elon Musk, who had received $100
      million from the sale of his interest in PayPal two years earlier. Musk
      became the chairman of the board of directors and the largest shareholder
      of Tesla.[8][11][9] J. B. Straubel joined Tesla in May 2004 as Chief
      Technical Officer.[8] A lawsuit settlement agreed to by Eberhard and Tesla
      in September 2009 allows all five – Eberhard, Tarpenning, Wright, Musk,
      and Straubel – to call themselves co-founders.[12] Roadster (2005–2009)

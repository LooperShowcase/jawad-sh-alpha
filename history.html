      The company was incorporated as Tesla Motors, Inc. on July 1, 2003, by
      Martin Eberhard and Marc Tarpenning.[8] Eberhard and Tarpenning served as
      CEO and CFO, respectively.[9] Eberhard said he wanted to build "a car
      manufacturer that is also a technology company", with its core
      technologies as "the battery, the computer software, and the proprietary
      motor".[10] Ian Wright was Tesla's third employee, joining a few months
      later.[8] In February 2004, the company raised $7.5 million in series A
      funding, including $6.5 million from Elon Musk, who had received $100
      million from the sale of his interest in PayPal two years earlier. Musk
      became the chairman of the board of directors and the largest shareholder
      of Tesla.[8][11][9] J. B. Straubel joined Tesla in May 2004 as Chief
      Technical Officer.[8] A lawsuit settlement agreed to by Eberhard and Tesla
      in September 2009 allows all five – Eberhard, Tarpenning, Wright, Musk,
      and Straubel – to call themselves co-founders.[12] Roadster (2005–2009)
